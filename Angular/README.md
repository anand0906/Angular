<h1>Angular</h1>
<p>Angular is a popular open-source framework for building dynamic, interactive web applications.</p>
<p>It leverages the power of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, to ensure a more structured and scalable development experience.</p>
<p>Angular's core strength lies in building single-page applications (SPA). These applications load the initial HTML page with the necessary resources and then dynamically update content within that page in response to user interactions. This results in smoother, more app-like experiences within the web browser.</p>
<p>Angular is developed and maintained by Google, ensuring strong backing, active community, and long-term support.</p>

<h2>Angular Development Environment Setup</h2>
<p>To install Angular on your local system, you need the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Node.js : <code>node -v</code></li>
	<li>npm package manager : <code>npm -v</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Check the versions of Node.js, TypeScript, and RxJS that each version of Angular requires at <a href="https://angular.io/guide/versions">Link</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.</p>
<p>To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:</p>
<code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
<p>To Check whether angular is installed or not, run the following command</p>
<code>ng version</code>


<p>Here are some key concepts associated with Angular:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Components</li>
	<li>Templates</li>
	<li>Directives</li>
	<li>Dependency injection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications.</p>
<p>They provide a way to structure your UI into self-contained, reusable units.</p>
<p>A component in Angular is a TypeScript class that encapsulates the data, behavior, and structure related to a part of the UI.</p>
<p>Each component consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>TypeScript Class:</strong>A TypeScript class defines the component's behavior. It contains properties to hold data and methods to implement functionality. This is where you handle user interactions, communicate with services, and manage the component's state.</li>
	<li><strong>HTML Template:</strong>The HTML template determines the structure and presentation of the component's view. It uses Angular's special syntax (directives, data binding, etc.) to create dynamic and interactive elements.</li>
	<li><strong>CSS Styles:</strong>Optional but highly recommended, CSS styles define the look and feel of the component. you can use component-specific styles or global stylesheets.</li>
	<li><strong>Metadata (@Component decorator):</strong>The @Component decorator provides Angular with essential information about how to create and use the component. It includes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>selector:</strong> A tag name used to insert the component into HTML templates of other components.</li>
		<li><strong>templateUrl:</strong> The path to the HTML template.</li>
		<li><strong>styleUrls:</strong> An array of paths to CSS files.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Angular applications typically have a tree-like component structure. A root component (often calledÂ AppComponent) holds other components, which may contain further nested components.</p>
<p>Imagine a tree, where the root component acts as the trunk. This root component, usually named AppComponent, forms the foundation of your application and is typically responsible for bootstrapping the entire application.</p>
<p>From this root, branches represent child components nested within the AppComponent's template. These child components can further have their own nested components, creating a hierarchical structure that mirrors the organization of your application's UI.</p>

<h3>Creation Of Component</h3>
<p>Creating components in Angular can be done in two ways</p>

<h4>Using Angular CLI</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Navigate to Project Directory</li>
	<p>Run This Command in terminal : <code>cd your-project-name</code></p>
	<li>Generate a New Component:</li>
	<p>Run the <code> ng generate component component-name</code> command, where component-name is the name of your new component.</p>
	<li>Explore the Generated Files:</li>
	<p>The Angular CLI will generate the following files for your component:</p>
	<p>A folder with the component's name is created under your current directory.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>'component-name.component.ts': The TypeScript file containing the component class.</li>
		<li>'component-name.component.html': The HTML template associated with the component.</li>
		<li>'component-name.component.css' (or scss): The styles for the component.</li>
		<li>'component-name.component.spec.ts': The unit test file for the component.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<p>You can change how ng generate component creates new components. <a href="https://angular.io/cli/generate#component-command">Check Here</a></p>

<h4>Creating a component manually</h4>
<p>Although the Angular CLI is the best way to create an Angular component, you can also create a component manually. This section describes how to create the core component file within an existing Angular project.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create the component folder: Make a new folder under src/app.</li>
	<li>Create the TypeScript file (component-name.component.ts): Define your component class and decorate it with @Component.</li>
	<li>Create the HTML file (component-name.component.html): Write the component's template.</li>
	<li>Create the CSS file (component-name.component.css): Add styles for your component (optional).</li>
	<li>Configure @Component Decorator</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Define selector: An HTML tag that identifies where the component will be inserted into templates.</li>
		<li>Define templateUrl: The path to the HTML template.</li>
		<li>Define styleUrls: An array of paths to CSS stylesheets.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Export the class, so that it can be imported to where it needs</li>
</ol>

<h4>Use Component</h4>
<p>To use your new component:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Import it: Import the component's class into the TypeScript file of the component where you want to use it.</li>
	<li>Declare in the @NgModule: Add the component to the declarations array of the Angular module (usually AppModule) that it belongs to.</li>
	<li>Use the selector: Add the component's selector tag in the template of the parent component where you want it to be rendered.</li>
</ol>

```TypeScript
// component-name.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component-name',
  templateUrl: './component-name.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./component-name.component.css']
})
export class ComponentNameComponent {
  // Component logic goes here
}
```

<h3>Defining Component/Css Selector</h3>
<p>In Angular, the component selector is a crucial aspect of how your components are used and identified within your application.</p>
<p>The component selector, defined within the @Component decorator, is a CSS-like string that acts as a unique identifier for your component in the HTML templates of other components. It tells Angular where to instantiate and render your component's view.</p>
<p>Consider a component named ProductDetailsComponent with the following selector:</p>

```TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-details',
  templateUrl: './product-details.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product-details.component.css']
})
export class ProductDetailsComponent {
  // ...
}
```
<p>Now, you can use this component in another component's template like this:</p>

```TypeScript
<app-product-details [product]="selectedProduct"></app-product-details>
```
<p>Here, app-product-details directly references the selector defined in the @Component decorator, instructing Angular to render the ProductDetailsComponent at this location.</p>

<p>Best Practices for Component Selectors:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use kebab-case: Use hyphens (kebab-case) for your selector names (e.g., app-product-details) for better readability and consistency.</li>
	<li>Prefix with an app- prefix: It's recommended to prefix your component selectors with app- to avoid conflicts with other libraries or potential future HTML elements.</li>
	<li>Keep it unique: Ensure each component has a unique selector within your application to prevent unintended rendering behavior.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Defining a component's template</h3>
<p>In Angular, a component's template defines the user interface (UI) structure and appearance. It's essentially a blueprint for how your component will be visually displayed in the browser.</p>
<p>There are two primary ways to define a component's template:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Inline Template:</li>
	<p>This approach embeds the HTML code directly within the @Component decorator using the template property:</p>

```TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <h1>Hello, Angular!</h1>
    <p>This is my component's template.</p>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  // ...
}
```
	<p>Here, the HTML code between backticks (\`) defines the component's structure, including an h1 and a p element.</p>
	<li>External Template File:</li>
	<p>For complex or reusable components, it's recommended to use an external template file for better organization and separation of concerns. This involves:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Creating an HTML file:</strong> Create a new file under your component's folder, typically named component-name.component.html.</li>
		<li><strong>Referencing the file:</strong> In the @Component decorator, use the templateUrl property to specify the path to the external template file:</li>
	</ul>

```TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
})
export class MyComponent {
  // ...
}
```

</ol>

<h3>Declaring a component's styles</h3>
<p>There are two main ways to declare styles for your Angular components:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Inline Styles:</li>
	<p>This approach embeds the CSS code directly within the @Component decorator using the styles property:</p>

```TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  styles: [
    `
      h1 {
        color: blue;
      }
      p {
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    `
  ],
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html'
})
export class MyComponent {
  // ...
}
```
	<p>Here, the CSS code within the square brackets defines styles for h1 and p elements within the component's template.</p>
	<li>External Stylesheet:</li>
	<p>For more complex components or to maintain better separation of concerns, using an external stylesheet is recommended:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a CSS file: Create a new file under your component's folder, typically named component-name.component.css.</li>
		<li>Reference the file: In the @Component decorator, use the styleUrls property to specify the path to the external stylesheet:</li>
	</ul>

```TypeScript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css'],
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html'
})
export class MyComponent {
  // ...
}
```

</ol>

<h3>Lifecycle Hooks</h3>
<p>Angular provides a set of lifecycle hooks that allow developers to tap into various stages of a component's life cycle. These hooks enable you to perform actions at specific moments in the component's creation, update, and destruction processes.</p>
<p>After your application instantiates a component or directive by calling its constructor, Angular calls the hook methods you have implemented at the appropriate point in the lifecycle of that instance.</p>
<p>Here are the main Angular lifecycle hooks:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>constructor():</strong></li>
	<p>This is the first method that gets executed when Angular creates a component instance.</p>
	<p>It's used to initialize dependencies, services, and default values for the component's properties.</p>
	<li><strong>ngOnChanges:</strong></li>
	<p>This hook is called when one or more input properties (@Input Properties Only) of the component change.</p>
	<p>It receives a SimpleChanges object containing the previous and current values of the input properties.</p>
	<p>Called before ngOnInit() (if the component has bound inputs) and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, Input, OnChanges, SimpleChanges } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-details',
  template: `
    <p>Product Name: {{ product.name }}</p>
    <p>Product Price: {{ product.price }}</p>
  `
})
export class ProductDetailsComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() product: any;

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    if (changes['product'].currentValue !== changes['product'].previousValue) {
      console.log('Product details updated!');
    }
  }
}
```
    <li>ngOnInit()</li>
    <p>This hook is called once after the component has been initialized.</p>
    <p>It is commonly used for initialization tasks, such as fetching initial data.</p>
    <p>Called once, right after the component is initialized and its data-bound properties are set.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-list',
  template: ` ... ` // Your product display template
})
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
  products: any[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.products = this.dataService.getProducts();
  }
} 
```
	<li>ngDoCheck()</li>
	<p>ngDoCheck is called during every change detection cycle,</p>
	<p>Custom change detection: If you have specific logic to check for changes that Angular's default change detection mechanism might not capture, you can implement it in ngDoCheck.</p>
	<p>Fine-grained control: ngDoCheck allows developers to have fine-grained control over change detection and perform optimizations if needed.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, Input, DoCheck } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-check',
  template: '{{ data }}'
})
export class CustomCheckComponent implements DoCheck {
  @Input() data: any;

  previousData: any;

  ngDoCheck() {
    if (this.data !== this.previousData) {
      console.log('Data changed:', this.data);
      this.previousData = this.data;
    }
  }
}
```
	<li>ngAfterContentInit()</li>
	<p>It  is useful when you need to perform actions that depend on the initialization of content projected into the component using ng-content.</p>
	<p>This hook is called once after the content has been projected into the component but before ngAfterContentChecked.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, AfterContentInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-content',
  template: '<ng-content></ng-content>'
})
export class ContentComponent implements AfterContentInit {
  ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log('Content has been initialized');
  }
}

 import { Component } from '@angular/core';

 @Component({
   selector: 'app-container',
   template: `
     <app-content>
       <p>Projected content goes here.</p>
     </app-content>
   `
 })
 export class ContainerComponent {}
```
	<p>In this example, when ContainerComponent is created and ngAfterContentInit is called in ContentComponent, it logs a message indicating that the content has been initialized.</p>
	<p>Interacting with projected content: If your component uses ng-content to project content into it, ngAfterContentInit is a good place to interact with that content</p>
	<p>Accessing child components: If your component has child components, you can use ngAfterContentInit to interact with those child components after they have been initialized.</p>
	<li>ngAfterContentChecked()</li>
	<p>It is called after the content (projected content or child components) has been checked by Angular during every change detection cycle. This hook provides an opportunity to perform actions after Angular has checked the content and ensured that it is up to date.</p>
	<p>Interacting with projected content: If your component uses ng-content to project content into it, ngAfterContentChecked can be used to interact with that content after each change detection cycle.</p>

```Typescript
import { Component, AfterContentChecked } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-content',
  template: '<ng-content></ng-content>'
})
export class ContentComponent implements AfterContentChecked {
  ngAfterContentChecked() {
    console.log('Content has been checked');
  }
}

 import { Component } from '@angular/core';

 @Component({
   selector: 'app-container',
   template: `
     <app-content>
       <p>Projected content goes here.</p>
     </app-content>
   `
 })
 export class ContainerComponent {}
```
	<li>ngAfterViewInit()</li>
	<p>t is called after the component's view and its child views (if any) have been fully initialized. This hook provides an opportunity to interact with the view, perform additional setup, or execute logic that requires access to the rendered DOM elements.</p>
	<p>Any logic that needs to be executed after the view is fully initialized can be placed in this hook.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, AfterViewInit, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-styling',
  template: '<p #myParagraph>Dynamic styling</p>',
  styles: ['p { color: red; }']
})
export class CustomStylingComponent implements AfterViewInit {
  constructor(private elementRef: ElementRef) {}

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    const paragraphElement: HTMLElement = this.elementRef.nativeElement.querySelector('p');
    paragraphElement.style.fontSize = '20px';
  }
}

```
	<p>In this example, ngAfterViewInit is used to access a DOM element and apply a CSS style after the view has been initialized.</p>
	<li>ngAfterViewChecked()</li>
	<p>ngAfterViewChecked is part of the component's lifecycle and is called after every change detection cycle to notify that the view, including its child views, has been checked.</p>

```TypeSript
import { Component, AfterViewChecked } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-check-message',
  template: '<p>View check message</p>'
})
export class CheckMessageComponent implements AfterViewChecked {
  ngAfterViewChecked() {
    console.log('View has been checked');
  }
}
```
	<p>In this example, when CheckMessageComponent is created, ngAfterViewChecked is called after each change detection cycle, logging a message indicating that the view has been checked.</p>
	<li>ngOnDestroy()</li>
	<p>It is called just before a component is destroyed or removed from the DOM. This hook provides an opportunity to clean up resources, unsubscribe from observables, or perform any necessary cleanup operations before the component is removed.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { Subscription, interval } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-timer',
  template: '<p>{{ timerValue }}</p>'
})
export class TimerComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  timerValue: number = 0;
  private timerSubscription: Subscription;

  ngOnInit() {
    this.timerSubscription = interval(1000).subscribe(() => {
      this.timerValue++;
    });
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    // Unsubscribe from the observable to prevent memory leaks
    if (this.timerSubscription) {
      this.timerSubscription.unsubscribe();
    }
  }
}
```

<p>In this example, the TimerComponent subscribes to an observable when initialized. The ngOnDestroy hook is used to unsubscribe from the observable when the component is destroyed, ensuring that there are no memory leaks.</p>
</ol>


<h3>View Encapsulation</h3>
<p>View encapsulation is a core strategy in Angular that determines how the styles you define within a component are applied to the component's template (its HTML). This mechanism lets you control the CSS stylesheet's influence, ensuring that styles intended for one component don't accidentally leak into other components, promoting modularity and maintainability.</p>
<p>Angular provides three primary encapsulation modes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Emulated (Default):</li>
	<p>Angular achieves style scoping not through true Shadow DOM, but by emulating (resembling) its behavior.</p>
	<p>It adds unique attributes to elements within your component's template and modifies your CSS selectors to target those attributes specifically. </p>
	<p> This ensures that your styles are effectively contained within the component, even without native browser support for Shadow DOM.</p>
	<li>ShadowDom:</li>
	<p>Angular leverages the browser's native Shadow DOM implementation to truly isolate the component's styles.</p>
	<p>The Shadow DOM is a browser feature that enables a fundamental level of encapsulation within web development. It allows you to attach a hidden, separate DOM tree to an element. This attached tree is known as the "shadow tree", and the element it's attached to is referred to as the "shadow host".</p>
	<p>CSS styles defined within a shadow tree are strictly isolated from the rest of the document. This prevents styles from unintentionally leaking into other parts of your web page, promoting modularity and avoiding conflicts.</p>
	<p>Styles defined within a Shadow DOM are completely isolated from the rest of the document. This eliminates the risk of external styles inadvertently affecting your components and vice versa.</p>
	<p>Ensure adequate browser support if you intend to use Shadow DOM in production. Older browsers might need polyfills.</p>
	<li>None:</li>
	<p>With this mode, there's no style encapsulation. The styles you define in the component become global styles, affecting the entire application. Use this with caution, mainly for intentionally creating global styles.</p>
</ul>
<p>The default Emulated mode is generally safe and provides a good level of style isolation for most use cases. If you need the absolute strongest encapsulation and have good browser support, ShadowDom is an option. None should be used sparingly.</p>
<p>You control the view encapsulation mode for a component using the encapsulation property within the component's decorator:</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom // Example: Using Shadow DOM 
})
export class MyComponent { ... }
```

<p>See Example for more clarity : <a href="https://angular.io/guide/view-encapsulation">Click Here</a></p>

<h3>Component Interaction</h3>
<p>Component interaction in Angular refers to the communication and data exchange between different components in an Angular application. </p>
<p>Components are the building blocks of an Angular application, and they often need to interact with each other to share data, trigger actions, or respond to changes.</p>
<p>There are several ways components can interact in Angular:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>@Input and @Output Decorators:</strong></li>
	<p>@Input: Allows a parent component to pass data to a child component. The child component declares an input property using @Input, and the parent component binds data to this property in the template.</p>

```TypeScript
// Child Component
@Input() inputData: string;

<!-- Parent Component Template -->
<app-child-component [inputData]="parentData"></app-child-component>
```
	<p>@Output: Allows a child component to emit events to the parent component. The child component declares an output property using @Output and an EventEmitter. The parent component listens for the emitted events in the template.</p>

```TypeScript
// Parent component (parent.component.ts)
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    <app-child [message]="parentMessage"></app-child>
  `
})
export class ParentComponent {
  parentMessage = 'Hello from parent!';
}

// Child component (child.component.ts)
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  `
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() message: string;
}
```
	<li><strong>Local Reference</strong></li>
	<p>local references (or template reference variables) provide a way to directly access an HTML element or a component from within the template of the current component. </p>
	<p>ou define a local reference by adding a hashtag (#) followed by a reference variable name to an HTML element in your component's template. For example:</p>

```TypeScript
<input type="text" #myInput>
```
	<p>Now there's a local reference variable named "myInput".</p>
	<p>Accessing an HTML Element: The local reference gives you a direct handle to the underlying HTML element (in the above example, the input element). You can access its properties and methods using the reference variable.</p>

```html
<h3>Countdown to Liftoff (via local variable)</h3>
<button type="button" (click)="timer.start()">Start</button>
<button type="button" (click)="timer.stop()">Stop</button>
<div class="seconds">{{timer.seconds}}</div>
<app-countdown-timer #timer></app-countdown-timer>
```
	<li><strong>@ViewChild</strong></li>
	<p>ViewChild is a decorator provided by Angular that allows a component to access a child component or element within its template</p>
	<p>It essentially injects a reference to the child component or element into the parent component. This enables the parent component to interact with the child's properties, methods, and events.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { MyChildComponent } from './my-child.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    <app-child #myChild></app-child>
    <button (click)="changeTitle()">Change Child Title</button>
  `
})
export class ParentComponent {
  @ViewChild('myChild') myViewChild: MyChildComponent;

  changeTitle() {
    this.myViewChild.title = 'New Title from Parent';
  }
}

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  `
})
export class MyChildComponent {
  @Input() title = 'Default Title';
}

```
	<p>The myViewChild variable in the ParentComponent holds a reference to the MyChildComponent instance.</p>
	<p>The changeTitle method in the parent component accesses the title property of the child component and modifies it.</p>
	<li><strong>Shared Services</strong></li>
	<p>A shared service is a singleton object created in Angular to encapsulate data or behavior that needs to be shared between multiple components in your application. These components could be siblings, parent-child, or other unrelated components.</p>
	<p>Since they are singletons, there's only one instance of the service created for the entire application. This means any changes made to the data within a shared service will be reflected across all the components that use it.</p>

```TypeScript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root' // Ensures a single instance across the application 
})
export class DataService {
  sharedData: string = 'Initial value';

  setData(newData: string) {
    this.sharedData = newData;
  }

  getData(): string {
    return this.sharedData;
  }
}

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service'; 

@Component({ ... })
export class ComponentA {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

   updateData() {
     this.dataService.setData('Updated data');
   }
}

// Another component:
@Component ({ ... })
export class ComponentB {
   constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

   displayData() {
     console.log(this.dataService.getData()); 
   }
}

```
	
</ol>

<h3>Customizing Component Styles</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Using Css Variables</li>
	<p>CSS Custom Properties, also known as CSS Variables, allow you to define values in a stylesheet that can be reused throughout the stylesheet.</p>
	<p>They are prefixed with -- and are referenced using the var() function.</p>
	Users of your component can customize the look by overriding these variables in their own stylesheets, either globally or specifically targeting your component:
	<p>If users want to apply customization directly in the template, they can do so using the style attribute.html</p>

```css
/* my-button.component.css */
:host {
  --my-button-bg-color: #3498db; /* Default background color */
  --my-button-text-color: white;  /* Default text color */

  background-color: var(--my-button-bg-color);
  color: var(--my-button-text-color);
}

/* Global customization */
my-button {
  --my-button-bg-color: red;
}

/* Or, within another component */
.custom-style my-button { 
  --my-button-text-color: black; 
} 

<!-- parent.component.html -->

<app-my-button style="--my-button-bg-color: #e74c3c; --my-button-text-color: black;"></app-my-button>

```
	<li>@Mixins</li>
	<p>Mixins are reusable blocks of styles you can include within other CSS rules.  They often accept parameters, allowing for dynamic customization.</p>

```css
@mixin button-variant($color) {
  background-color: $color;
  border-color: $color;
}

.primary-button {
  @include button-variant(blue);
}
```
	<p>Angular components, by default, use a feature called View Encapsulation. This creates a scoping mechanism for styles, ensuring they only apply within the component where they are defined, preventing styles from clashing with other components.</p>
	<p>So,Direct @mixins Are Not Used in Angular's Styling:</p>
	<p> You can use Sass or Less if you include it in your project setup. Create functions that accept parameters and return CSS blocks, similar to mixin concepts:</p>

```scss
// _functions.scss
@function button-variant($color) {
  background-color: $color;
  border-color: $color;
  @return;
}

// my-component.component.scss
.primary-button {
  @include button-variant(blue);
}

```
<p>Create a separate .scss file (e.g., _functions.scss) containing your global styles and mixins.</p>
	<p>Import this file in your angular.json file within the styles array of the build section:</p>

```json
// angular.json
{
  "architect": {
    "build": {
      "options": {
        "styles": [
          "src/styles.css",
          "src/_functions.scss" // Your global styles and mixins
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
	<p>In your component styles, you can now import and use the global mixin. Let's say you have a component named app-example:</p>

```css
/* app-example.component.scss */

@import '../../styles'; // Adjust the path based on your project structure

@include globalStyles();

// Additional component-specific styles

```
</ol>

<h3>Content Projection</h3>
<p>Content projection in Angular is a powerful feature that allows you to insert and project content from a One component into another component. This enables you to create more flexible and reusable components by separating the structure and behavior of the components.</p>
<p>Types of Content Projection</p>
<ol>
	<li>Single-Slot Content Projection</li>
	<li>Multi-Slot Content Projection</li>
	<li>Conditional content projection</li>
</ol>
<h4>Single Slot Content Projection</h4>
<p>The most basic form.</p>
<p>You have a single ng-content tag in your component's template</p>
<p>Any content placed between the component's opening and closing tags in the parent component is projected into that slot.</p>
<p>please import common module to use these examples</p>

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">
    <ng-content></ng-content> 
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Default card content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```TypeScript
<app-card>
  <h2>Custom Title</h2>
  <img src="my-image.jpg" alt="Image">
</app-card>
```

<p>The content placed within the app-card tags (the h2 and img) will get projected directly into the card-header section of your card component.</p>
<p>The overall result looks as follows</p>

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">
    <h2>Custom Title</h2>
  	<img src="my-image.jpg" alt="Image">
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Default card content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

<h4>Multiple Content Projection</h4>
<p>You can have multiple ng-content tags</p>
<p>you can name them as tag name, attribute, CSS class, and the :not pseudo-class. to differentiate between different content insertion points</p>
<p>When using the component, any elements in the parent component that match the specified CSS selectors will be projected into the corresponding ng-content slots.</p>

```html
<!-- parent.component.html -->
<div>
  <h2>Parent Component</h2>
  <ng-content select=".header"></ng-content>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>

<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-parent>
  <div class="header">Header Content</div>
  <p>Regular Content</p>
</app-parent>

```

<p>In this case, the content with the class "header" is projected into the first ng-content in the parent component, and the remaining content is projected into the second ng-content.</p>
<p>If your component includes an ng-content element without a select attribute, that instance receives all projected components that do not match any of the other ng-content elements.</p>

<h4>Conditional Content Projection</h4>
<p>This technique allows you to display projected content based on specific conditions or logic within your component. It's a powerful way to make your components even more adaptable.</p>
<p>It refers to the ability to project different content into a child component based on certain conditions in the parent component. This feature is particularly useful when you want to customize the content that gets projected into a child component depending on specific criteria or dynamic circumstances.</p>

<h5>ng-container</h5>
<p>t acts as a grouping element without adding an extra layer to your DOM (Document Object Model). This means it won't be rendered as a real HTML element in the browser.</p>
<p> The primary use of ng-container is with structural directives (like *ngIf, *ngFor). Structural directives alter how the DOM is shaped. ng-container gives you a clean way to apply these directives without introducing unnecessary HTML tags.</p>

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="showContent">
  <div>Some content here</div>
  <p>More content</p>
</ng-container>
```

<h5>ng-template</h5>
<p>Defines a template that isn't directly rendered. It's a blueprint for content that you can instantiate later, either conditionally or repeatedly.</p>
<p>The content inside ng-template won't display on its own.</p>
<p>ng-template usually works with structural directives and the NgTemplateOutlet directive to dynamically insert the template into the DOM.</p>

```html
<ng-template #errorTemplate>
  <p class="error"> An error occurred! </p>
</ng-template>

<ng-container *ngIf="hasError; else successTemplate">
  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="errorTemplate"></ng-container>
</ng-container>

<ng-template #successTemplate>
  <p>Success!</p> 
</ng-template>
```

<p>In Conditional Content Projection,Using an ng-content element in these cases is not recommended, because when the consumer of a component supplies the content, that content is always initialized, even if the component does not define an ng-content element or if that ng-content element is inside of an ngIf statement.</p>
<p>With an ng-template element, you can have your component explicitly render content based on any condition you want, as many times as you want. Angular will not initialize the content of an ng-template element until that element is explicitly rendered.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Components</h3>
<p>Dynamic components in Angular refer to the creation and rendering of components at runtime, rather than at compile time. This allows you to build more flexible and dynamic user interfaces</p>
<p>Static applications have pre-defined components in their templates.</p>
<p>Dynamic components are useful when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You need to display components based on user interaction</li>
	<li>You have a large number of components that are not always needed on the page</li>
	<p>You want to create a more modular and adaptable application architecture.</p>
</ul>
<p>There are two primary approaches to creating dynamic components in Angular:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using NgComponentOutlet:</li>
	<li>Using the ComponentFactoryResolver Service:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Using NgComponentOutlet:</h4>
<p>The NgComponentOutlet directive can be used to instantiate components and insert them into the current view. This directive allows you to provide a component class that should be rendered, as well as component inputs to be used during initialization.</p>

```TypeScript

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <div class="job-ad">
      <h4>{{ headline }}</h4>
      {{ body }}
    </div>
  `,
})
export class HeroJobAdComponent {
  @Input() headline!: string;
  @Input() body!: string;
}

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <div class="hero-profile">
      <h3>Featured Hero Profile</h3>
      <h4>{{ name }}</h4>
      <p>{{ bio }}</p>
      <strong>Hire this hero today!</strong>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class HeroProfileComponent {
  @Input() name!: string;
  @Input() bio!: string;
}

import { Injectable, Type } from '@angular/core';
import { HeroProfileComponent } from './hero-profile.component';
import { HeroJobAdComponent } from './hero-job-ad.component';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AdService {
  getAds() {
    return [
      {
        component: HeroProfileComponent,
        inputs: { name: 'Dr. IQ', bio: 'Smart as they come' },
      },
      {
        component: HeroProfileComponent,
        inputs: { name: 'Bombasto', bio: 'Brave as they come' },
      },
      {
        component: HeroJobAdComponent,
        inputs: {
          headline: 'Hiring for several positions',
          body: 'Submit your resume today!',
        },
      },
      {
        component: HeroJobAdComponent,
        inputs: {
          headline: 'Openings in all departments',
          body: 'Apply today',
        },
      },
    ] as {component: Type<any>, inputs: Record<string, unknown>}[];
  }
}


@Component({
  selector: 'app-ad-banner',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [NgComponentOutlet, AsyncPipe],
  template: `
    <div class="ad-banner-example">
      <h3>Advertisements</h3>
      <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="
        currentAd.component;
        inputs: currentAd.inputs;
      " />
      <button (click)="displayNextAd()">Next</button>
    </div>
  `
})
export class AdBannerComponent {
  private adList = inject(AdService).getAds();

  private currentAdIndex = 0;

  get currentAd() {
    return this.adList[this.currentAdIndex];
  }

  displayNextAd() {
    this.currentAdIndex++;
    // Reset the current ad index back to `0` when we reach the end of an array.
    if (this.currentAdIndex === this.adList.length) {
      this.currentAdIndex = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

<h3>Angular Elements</h3>
<p>Angular Elements provides a way to take your Angular components and turn them into standard custom elements (also known as Web Components). This empowers you to use your well-crafted Angular components directly within non-Angular applications or even basic HTML pages.</p>
<p>Uses</p>
<ul>
	<li>Custom elements are a native browser feature, making Angular Elements usable in projects built with React, Vue, vanilla JavaScript, or any other framework (or even no framework at all!).</li>
	<li>This can aid in incremental migration. You can package existing Angular components as custom elements and introduce them into a legacy application built with a different technology.</li>
	<li>Build micro-frontends: different parts of a large application can be developed independently (even using different frameworks), while retaining seamless integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to create</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create an Angular Component: Develop your Angular component as you typically would.</li>
	<li>Use the @angular/elements Package: Install this package and its polyfills for older browser support.</li>
	<li>createCustomElement Function: Utilize the createCustomElement function to convert your Angular component into a custom element.</li>
	<li>Register the Custom Element: Use JavaScript's customElements.define() function to register your newly created custom element.</li>
</ol>

```TypeScript
import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';
import { MyAngularComponent } from './my-angular.component';

const customElement = createCustomElement(MyAngularComponent, { injector: this.injector });
customElements.define('my-angular-element', customElement);
```

<p>You can use your my-angular-element tag in any HTML document as if it were any standard HTML element.</p>


<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>In Angular, templates are a fundamental part of the framework that allow you to define the structure and layout of your application's user interface. Templates in Angular are typically written in HTML and can include Angular-specific syntax and directives to bind data, handle events, and manipulate the DOM.</p>
<p>Almost all HTML syntax is valid template syntax. However, because an Angular template is only a fragment of the UI, it does not include elements such as html, body, or base.</p>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>interpolation is a technique used to embed expressions within your templates, allowing you to display dynamic content based on your component's data.</p>
<p>It acts as a one-way data binding mechanism, bringing your component's properties and expressions to life in the UI.</p>
<p>Double curly braces: {{ expression }} is the syntax used to mark an interpolation point in the template.</p>
<p>Expressions inside: The expression within the braces can be a reference to a component property, a valid JavaScript expression, or even a combination of both.</p>

```TypeScript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <h1>Welcome, {{ username }}!</h1>
    <p>Your age is {{ calculateAge(birthYear) }}.</p>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  username = 'John Doe';
  birthYear = 1990;

  calculateAge(year: number): number {
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
    return currentYear - year;
  }
}
```

<p> Angular evaluates the expression within the double curly braces and replaces it with the resulting value.</p>
<h3>Template Statements</h3>
<p>template statements are used for event binding. They allow you to respond to user actions, such as button clicks or mouse events, by executing methods defined in your Angular component</p>
<p> Template statements are enclosed in parentheses and are used within the HTML templates to bind to events.</p>

```TypeScript
// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me!</button>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  message: string = '';

  onButtonClick(): void {
    this.message = 'Button clicked!';
  }
}
```

<p>(click)="onButtonClick()" is a template statement that binds the onButtonClick() method to the click event of the button element.</p>
<p>When the button is clicked, the onButtonClick() method is executed, updating the message property in the component.</p>
<p>Template statements are enclosed in parentheses. The content inside the parentheses typically consists of an event name (e.g., click) followed by the method or expression to be executed when the event occurs.</p>

<h4>Statement Context</h4>
<p>In Angular templates, statement context refers to the specific environment within which a template statement operates. This context determines what elements the statement has access to and can interact with.</p>
<p>	The context of a template statement can be the component class instance or the template.</p>
<p>Typically, the statement context is the component class instance. This means that statements within a template can directly access properties and methods defined in the component class.</p>
<p>Template statements can also access elements within their own context.</p>
<p>Template reference variables: These are references assigned to specific DOM elements within the template, allowing the statement to interact with the element.</p>
<p>The $event object: This object is available in event handler statements and provides details about the event that triggered the statement.</p>
<p>Statement context has priority over global scope. This means template statements cannot directly access global variables or functions like window or console.log.
</p>

```html
<button type="button" (click)="onSave($event)">Save</button>
<button type="button" *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="deleteHero(hero)">{{hero.name}}</button>
<form #heroForm (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(heroForm)"> ... </form>
```

<p>The (click) event handler binds the click event on the button to the deleteHero method of the component class.</p>
<p>Inside the deleteHero statement, hero refers to the current item being iterated over in the loop (assuming the button is placed within an *ngFor loop).</p>
<p>This statement can access hero because it's within the context of the loop iteration, and hero is a local variable available in that context.</p>
<p>	In this example, the context of the $event object, hero, and #heroForm is the template.</p>
<p>	The statement context may also refer to properties of the template's own context. In the following example, the component's event handling method, onSave() takes the template's own $event object as an argument. On the next two lines, the deleteHero() method takes a template input variable, hero, and onSubmit() takes a template reference variable, #heroForm.
</p>
<p>	Template statements support basic assignment (=) and chaining expressions with semicolons (;) unlike template expressions. This allows for functionalities like setting variable values and executing multiple statements within a single line.</p>
<p>Template statements do not allow:</p>
<ul>	
	<li>new keyword</li>
	<li>Increment/decrement operators (++, --) and operator assignment (+=, -=, etc.) </li>
	<li>Bitwise operators (|, &, etc.) </li>
	<li>Pipe operator (|)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Template Binding</h3>
<p>In Angular, binding is a powerful mechanism that allows you to connect and synchronize data between the components (the TypeScript code) and the templates (the HTML code). </p>
<p>Creates a live connection between the component's data and the template elements.</p>
<p>Keeps the view and the model synchronized.</p>
<p>Allows user interactions in the view to update the model, and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are different types of bindings in Angular</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interpolation Binding:</li>
	<li>Property Binding:</li>
	<li>Event Binding:</li>
	<li>Two-way Binding:</li>
</ul>
<p>Bindings always have two parts: a <strong>target</strong> which will receive the bound value, and a <strong>template expression</strong> which produces a value from the model.</p>
<p>Template expressions are similar to JavaScript expressions. Many JavaScript expressions are legal template expressions, with the following exceptions.</p>
<p>You can't use JavaScript expressions that have or promote side effects, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)</li>
	<li>Operators such as new, typeof, or instanceof</li>
	<li>Chaining expressions with ; or ,</li>
	<li>The increment and decrement operators ++ and --</li>
	<li>Some of the ES2015+ operators</li>
	<li>No support for the bitwise operators such as | and &</li>
</ul>
<h4>Name Collison</h4>
<p>The evaluation context of an expression in a template is a combination of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Template variables: Variables defined within the current template.</li>
	<li>Directive's context object: If the directive used in the element defines a context object.</li>
	<li>Component's member names: Properties and methods defined in the component class.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a name belongs to multiple contexts, Angular follows this precedence order:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Template variable name: Takes highest priority.</li>
	<li>Directive's context object name: If applicable.</li>
	<li>Component's member names: Lowest priority.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best practice is to choose unique names for variables across different contexts to avoid confusion and potential errors.</p>

<h3>Property Binding</h4>
<p>Property binding in Angular is a one-way data binding technique that allows you to set the value of a property of a DOM element or a directive based on the value of a property in the component class.</p>
<p>This binding is useful for dynamically updating the properties of HTML elements or Angular directives in response to changes in the component.</p>
<p>Property binding is denoted by square brackets [] in the template</p>
<p>Enclose the property name in square brackets [] within the element tag.</p>
<p>Assign a component property to the target property using =.</p>

```html
<img alt="item" [src]="itemImageUrl">
```
<p>src is the target property of the img element.</p>
<p>itemImageUrl is a component property holding the image URL.</p>
<p>Angular evaluates the right-hand side expression (e.g., itemImageUrl) and retrieves its value.</p>
<p>Angular sets the target property to the evaluated value, dynamically updating the element's behavior or appearance.</p>

<p>Target property names often correspond to HTML attribute names (e.g., src, href, disabled).</p>
<p>Square brackets mark dynamic evaluation. Without them, Angular treats the value as a static string.</p>
<p>To assign a string to a component's property (such as the childItem of the ItemDetailComponent), remove square brackets</p>

```html
<app-item-detail childItem="parentItem"></app-item-detail>
```

<p>It can also be used in data sharing between two components</p>


<h4>DOM Properties vs Html Attributes</h4>

<p><strong>DOM Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript properties associated with HTML elements in the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
	<li>Accessible and modifiable using JavaScript code, allowing dynamic control over element behavior and appearance.</li>
	<li>Examples: innerHTML, style, value, disabled, checked, etc.</li>
	<li>Not directly reflected in HTML source code: Changes made through DOM properties don't always update the original HTML attribute values.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HTML Attributes:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Defined within the HTML tag itself, providing information about the element and its behavior.</li>
	<li>Usually static, defined in the HTML code and typically not meant to be changed dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
	<li>src, href, id, class, alt, etc.</li>
	<li>Changes made to attributes directly modify the HTML code.</li>
</ul>

<p>DOM properties allow for dynamic control of elements' appearance and behavior through JavaScript.</p>
<li>HTML attributes provide static information about elements and are used for initial configuration.</li>

<h3>Attribute Binding</h4>
<p>Attribute binding in Angular is a technique used to set the value of an HTML element's attribute directly from a component's property. While similar to property binding, it caters to specific scenarios.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Targets element attributes, not DOM properties. This is useful for attributes that don't have direct DOM property counterparts</li>
	<li> Uses the attr. prefix followed by the attribute name in square brackets []. The value is assigned using the equal sign =.</li>
</ul>

```html
<td [attr.colspan]="columnSpan"></td>
```
<p>[attr.colspan]: Attribute binding for the colspan attribute.</p>
<p>columnSpan: Component property holding the desired colspan value.</p>

<p>When to use attribute binding:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Non-DOM property attributes: When there's no corresponding DOM property for the attribute you want to set.</li>
	<li>Dynamic attribute values: When the attribute value needs to be determined at runtime based on component data.</li>
	<li>Custom directives: When working with directives that expect specific attributes to be set.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Class & Style Binding</h3>
<p>In Angular templates, class binding and style binding are powerful techniques that allow you to dynamically add, remove, or modify CSS classes and inline styles of your HTML elements based on data in your component class.</p>
<h4>Class Binding</h4>
<p>Dynamically manage an element's CSS classes based on component properties.</p>

```html
<button [class.active]="isActive">Click me!</button>

<td align="left"><code>{width: '100px', height: '100px'}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

```html
<h1 [style.color]="isError ? 'red' : 'green'">Heading</h1>
```
<p>The heading's color switches between red (if isError is true) and green.</p>

<h3>Event Binding</h3>
<p>Event binding in Angular allows you to capture and respond to user-generated events (such as button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs) within your application. With event binding, you can execute methods in your component class in response to these events.</p>
<p>Binds an event occurring on an HTML element (like a click, keypress, or mouseover) to a method defined in your component class.</p>
<p>Triggers the execution of the bound method when the event happens on the element.</p>
<p>Enables your component to handle user interactions and react accordingly.</p>

```TypeScript
(event-name)="method-name($event)"
```

<p>(event-name): Represents the HTML event you want to listen for (e.g., (click), (keyup)).</p>
<p>"method-name": The name of the method in your component class that you want to execute when the event occurs.</p>
<p>($event) (optional): An optional argument representing an event object containing details about the triggered event.</p>

```TypeScript
<button (click)="handleClick($event)">Click me!</button>

export class AppComponent {
  handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {
    alert('Button clicked!');
    console.log('Event object:', event);
  }
}

```
<p>Clicking the button triggers the handleClick method in the component class.</p>
<p>The $event argument (optional here) provides access to the event object, which contains details like the button clicked and any modifier keys pressed during the click.</p>

<p>You can bind multiple events to the same element (e.g., (click)="handleClick()" (mouseover)="handleHover()").</p>

<h3>Two Way Data Binding</h3>
<p>Two-way data binding in Angular is a mechanism that establishes a synchronized connection between an element's value in the template (view) and a property in your component class (model). This means changes made in one place are automatically reflected in the other, creating a seamless flow of data.</p>
<p>Combines property binding and event binding: It leverages both concepts to achieve two-way communication.
</p>
<p>Syntax: Achieved using the [(ngModel)] directive.</p>
<p>Commonly used with forms: Ideal for scenarios where user input in form elements needs to be reflected back to the component's data and vice versa.</p>
<p>Two-way data binding is denoted by the [(ngModel)] directive in the template. It combines the square bracket syntax of property binding ([property]) with the parentheses syntax of event binding (event).</p>

```html
<!-- Syntax for Two-Way Data Binding -->
<element [(ngModel)]="property"></element>
```
<p>Here, property is a property in your component class.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where you want to bind an input field to a property in your component class and reflect any changes in both the input field and the component.</p>

```TypeScript
// Component class
export class ExampleComponent {
  inputValue = 'Initial Value';
}

<!-- Template with Two-Way Data Binding -->
<input [(ngModel)]="inputValue" />

```

<p>In this example, the inputValue property is bound to the value of the input field, and any changes in the input field will automatically update the inputValue property in the component class.</p>

<p>To use two-way data binding, you need to import the FormsModule in your Angular module and add it to the imports array. This module provides the ngModel directive.</p>

```TypeScript
// Import the FormsModule in your Angular module
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other modules
    FormsModule
  ],
  // other configurations
})
export class AppModule { }
```

<p>Behind the scenes, Angular combines property binding and event binding to achieve two-way data binding. The [(ngModel)] directive binds the value of the input field to the property in the component and listens for the input event to update the property when the user types.</p>

```html
<!-- Equivalent Syntax Combining Property and Event Binding -->
<input [ngModel]="inputValue" (ngModelChange)="inputValue=$event" />
```

<p>Two-way data binding simplifies the code required to keep the template and component in sync, especially in scenarios where user input needs to be reflected immediately in the component and vice versa. It's important to note that two-way data binding requires the use of the FormsModule for the ngModel directive.</p>

<p>Potential performance issues: Frequent updates can impact performance in large forms. Consider alternatives like one-way data binding with manual updates in complex scenarios.</p>
<p>Use with caution: Not always necessary for simple data display. Evaluate the trade-offs based on your specific use case.</p>

<h3>Pipes</h3>
<p>Pipes in Angular are powerful tools that transform data displayed in your templates before it's presented to the user. They act like filters, manipulating the output of expressions to improve readability and user experience.</p>
<p>Pipes always produce the same output for the same input, ensuring predictable behavior.</p>
<p>Applied using the pipe operator (|) after an expression in the template.</p>
<p> Angular offers pre-built pipes for common tasks and allows you to create custom ones for specific needs.</p>
<ul>
	<li>DatePipe: Formats a date value according to locale rules.</li>
	<li>UpperCasePipe: Transforms text to all upper case.</li>
	<li>LowerCasePipe: Transforms text to all lower case.</li>
	<li>CurrencyPipe: Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.</li>
	<li>DecimalPipe: Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.</li>
	<li>PercentPipe: Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules</li>
	<li>AsyncPipe: Subscribe and unsubscribe to an asynchronous source such as an observable.</li>
	<li>JsonPipe: Display a component object property to the screen as JSON for debugging.</li>
	<li>More <a href="https://angular.io/api/common#pipes">Click Here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To use a pipe, you apply it to a binding expression in your template using the | symbol, followed by the pipe name and any additional parameters.</p>

```html
<!-- Example: Using the uppercase pipe -->
<p>{{ message | uppercase }}</p>
```
<p>In this example, the uppercase pipe is used to transform the message variable to uppercase before displaying it.</p>

<p>You can chain multiple pipes together to perform multiple transformations.</p>

```html
<!-- Example: Chaining the date and uppercase pipes -->
<p>{{ today | date:'short' | uppercase }}</p>
```

<p>In this example, the date pipe formats the today variable as a short date, and then the uppercase pipe transforms the result to uppercase.</p>

<p>You can create your own custom pipes for specific transformations that aren't covered by the built-in ones. Creating a custom pipe involves implementing the PipeTransform interface.</p>

```TypeScript
// Example: Custom pipe for reversing a string
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({ name: 'reverse' })
export class ReversePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.split('').reverse().join('');
  }
}

<p>{{ message | reverse }}</p>

```
<p>Here, the reverse pipe is a custom pipe that reverses the characters of the message variable.</p>

<p>The pipe operator has a higher precedence than the JavaScript ternary operator (?:).</p>
<p>condition ? a : b | pipe ->evaluted as-> condition ? a : (b | pipe)</p>

<p>If you want the pipe to apply to the result of the ternary expression, wrap the entire expression in parentheses. For example,</p>
<p>(condition ? a : b) | pipe</p>

<h3>Template Variables</h3>
<p>Template variables in Angular provide a way to capture and work with references to elements or components in your template. These variables are declared within the template and can be used to reference elements, components, or directives for various purposes.</p>
<p>Template variables in Angular provide a way to capture and work with references to elements or components in your template. These variables are declared within the template and can be used to reference elements, components, or directives for various purposes.</p>

```html
<!-- Example: Declaring a template variable for an input element -->
<input #inputVar type="text" />
```
<p>In this example, #inputVar is a template variable declared for the input element.</p>

<p>You can access the value of a template variable in the template or pass it to methods.</p>

```html
<!-- Example: Using the template variable value in the template -->
<p>{{ inputVar.value }}</p>
```
<p>In this example, the value of the inputVar template variable is displayed within a paragraph.</p>

<p>Template variables can be used to reference elements and interact with them in the component class</p>

```TypeScript
<!-- Example: Using a template variable to reference an element -->
<button #btn (click)="onClick(btn)">Click me</button>

// Component class
export class ExampleComponent {
  onClick(button: HTMLButtonElement) {
    console.log('Button clicked!', button);
  }
}
```

<p>In this example, the #btn template variable is used to reference the button element, and the reference is passed to the onClick method in the component class.</p>

<p>Template variables can also be used to reference components and interact with their properties or methods.</p>

```html
<!-- Example: Using a template variable to reference a component -->
<app-child #childCmp></app-child>
<button (click)="childCmp.doSomething()">Call Child Method</button>
```

<p>In this example, #childCmp is a template variable referencing the app-child component, and the doSomething method of the child component is called when the button is clicked.</p>

<p>Angular assigns a template variable a value based on where you declare the variable:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you declare the variable on a component, the variable refers to the component instance.</li>
	<li>If you declare the variable on a standard HTML tag, the variable refers to the element.</li>
	<li>If you declare the variable on an ng-template element, the variable refers to a TemplateRef instance which represents the template</li>
</ul>

<p>If the variable specifies a name on the right-hand side, such as #var="ngModel", the variable refers to the directive or component on the element with a matching exportAs name.</p>

```TypeScript
<form #itemForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(itemForm)">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" class="form-control" name="name" ngModel required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<div [hidden]="!itemForm.form.valid">
  <p>{{ submitMessage }}</p>
</div>
```

<p>The NgForm directive demonstrates getting a reference to a different value by referencing a directive's exportAs name. In the following example, the template variable, itemForm, appears three times separated by HTML.</p>
<p>Without the ngForm attribute value, the reference value of itemForm would be the HTMLFormElement, <form>. If an element is an Angular Component, a reference with no attribute value will automatically reference the component instance. Otherwise, a reference with no value will reference the DOM element, even if the element has one or more directives applied to it</p>
<p>Just like variables in JavaScript or TypeScript code, template variables are scoped to the template that declares them.</p>
<p>Similarly, Structural directives such as *ngIf and *ngFor, or <ng-template> declarations create a new nested template scope, much like JavaScript's control flow statements like if and for create new lexical scopes. You cannot access template variables within one of these structural directives from outside of its boundaries.</p>
